/*
Design a Java program to implement matrix arithmetic for square matrices (same number of rows and columns). You will
need to use your math textbook or the Internet to review operations with matrices.
Make sure that your program is calling methods to perform (at least) the following operations:
    -- Generate: Generate a matrix with random values 1 - 10
    -- Addition: See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixAddition.html
    -- Subtraction: Figure it out!
    -- Multiplication
        - Multiply two matrices: See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixMultiplication.html
        - Multiply a matrix by a scalar: Equivalent to multiplication of each element by that scalar.
    -- Transposition: See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Transpose.html
    -- Matrix Trace: See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixTrace.html
    -- Print (use printf)
    -- Have another method called menu(), that should list the options for matrix operations for which you designed the
    previous functions, and an option to exit the program. Your program should loop until the user chooses to exit.
    In this loop you are required to use a switch statement for all possible cases.
