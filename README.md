Assignment #1 For COSC237

Assignment description:

For this assignment (review on structured programming), you will work in teams of (at most) three students, but all teammates should contribute seriously (please let me know if thatâ€™s not the case). 

1. Design a Java program to implement matrix arithmetic for square matrices (same number of rows and columns). You will need to use your math textbook or the Internet to review operations with matrices.
2. Write a Java program to solve the following problem using modularity: Your program will invoke methods to initialize the array (random values between 1 and 100) print the array before the rotation, rotate the array, and then print the array (or the resulting array) after rotation. Use dynamic arrays and ask the user for the array size.
